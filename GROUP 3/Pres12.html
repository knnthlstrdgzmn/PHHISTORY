<p> popularly known as FVR and Eddie, is a retired Filipino general and politician who served as the 12th President of the Philippines from 1992 to 1998. During his six years in office, Ramos was<br> widely credited and admired by many for revitalizing and renewing international confidence in the Philippine economy. At age 90, he is currently the oldest living former Philippine President.<br>

Prior to his election as president, Ramos served in the cabinet of President Coraz√≥n Aquino, first as chief-of-staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), and later as Secretary of National<br> Defense from 1986 to 1991.[3] He was the father of the Philippine Army's Special Forces and the Philippine National Police Special Action Force.<br>

During the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution, Ramos was hailed as a hero by many Filipinos for his decision to break away from the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos and pledge allegiance <br>and loyalty to the newly established government of President Aquino. Thirty years later, he however shifted to the side of Rodrigo Duterte, who he persuaded to run for president against <br>Aquino's ally, Mar Roxas, and his nemesis, Miriam Defensor Santiago. Ramos also supported the Philippine Drug War, which has killed more than 14,000 Filipinos in less than two years. Five months <br>under the Duterte regime, Ramos admitted that he made the wrong decision to campaign for a Duterte presidency.</p>
