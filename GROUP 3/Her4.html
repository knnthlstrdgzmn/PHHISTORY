<p> , was a Filipino army general who fought in the Philippineâ€“American War.<br>

Regarded as one of the fiercest generals of his time, he succeeded Artemio Ricarte as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. He sought to apply his background in military science to<br> the fledgling army. A sharpshooter himself, he organized professional guerrilla soldiers later to be known as the "Luna Sharpshooters" and the "Black Guard". His three-tier defense, now known <br>as the Luna Defense Line, gave the American troops a hard campaign in the provinces north of Manila. This defense line culminated in the creation of a military base in the Cordillera.<br>

Despite his commitment to discipline the army and serve the Republic which attracted the admiration of people, his temper caused some to abhor him.[2] His efforts were not without recognition <br>during his time, for he was awarded the Philippine Republic Medal in 1899. He was also a member of the Malolos Congress.[3] Besides his military studies, Luna also studied pharmacy, literature and <br>chemistry.[4]</p>
