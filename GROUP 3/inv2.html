<p>   is a Filipino-American entrepreneur and engineer working in the high-tech industry, credited with having developed the first 10-Mbit Ethernet CMOS with silicon coupler data-link control and <br>transreceiver chip, the first system logic chip set for IBM's PC-XT and the PC-AT, and the local bus concept and the first Windows Graphics accelerator chip for personal computers. A three-time<br> start-up veteran, he co-founded Mostron, Chips and Technologies, and S3 Graphics.beginning with the world’s first 16-bit chip in 1972, which he invented while working at Commodore. This led to<br> the development of GUI (The thing that makes the graphics on this page…). Why should you care? Without GUI, you would now be looking at a page filled with nothing but a bunch of ones and zeroes.</p>
