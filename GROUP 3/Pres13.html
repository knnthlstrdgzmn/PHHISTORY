In 2001, he <br>became the first president in Asia to be impeached from an executive role. He has been Mayor of the City of Manila, the country's capital, since 2013.[1]<br>

Estrada gained popularity as a film actor, playing the lead role in over a hundred films in an acting career spanning some three decades, and model, who was started as a fashion and ramp model at <br>the age of 13. He used his popularity as an actor to make gains in politics, serving as Mayor of San Juan from 1969 to 1986, as Senator from 1987 to 1992, then as Vice-President under President<br> Fidel V. Ramos from 1992 to 1998.

Estrada was elected President in 1998 with a wide margin of votes separating him from the other challengers, and was sworn into the presidency on June 30, 1998. In 2000 he declared an "all-out-war" <br>against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and captured its headquarters and other camps.[2][3] However, allegations of corruption spawned an impeachment trial in the Senate, and in 2001 Estrada<br> was ousted by "People Power 2" after the prosecution walked out of the impeachment court when the Senator-Judges voted "no" in the opening of the second envelope.<br>

In 2007, Estrada was sentenced by the special division of the Sandiganbayan to reclusi√≥n perpetua for the plunder of stealing $80 million from the government and was sentenced to a lifetime in <br>prison, but was later granted pardon by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. He ran for president again in the 2010 presidential election, but was defeated by Senator Benigno Aquino III by a wide <br>margin.</p>
