<p> PLH, (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈseɾ.xjo ozˈmeɲa]; 9 September 1878 – 19 October 1961) was a Filipino politician who served as the third President of the Philippines from 1944 to 1946. He was <br>Vice President under Manuel L. Quezon. Upon Quezon's sudden death in 1944, Osmeña succeeded him, at age 65, becoming the oldest holder of the office (a record he held until 71-year old Rodrigo <br>Duterte was elected in 2016). A founder of the Nacionalista Party, Osmeña was also the first Visayan to become President.<br>

Prior to his accession in 1944, Osmeña served as Governor of Cebu from 1906 to 1907, Member and first Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives from 1907 to 1922, and Senator from the 10th<br> Senatorial District for thirteen years, in which capacity he served as Senate President pro tempore. In 1935, he was nominated to be the running-mate of Senate President Manuel L. Quezon for <br>the presidential election that year. The duo were overwhelmingly re-elected in 1941.</p>
